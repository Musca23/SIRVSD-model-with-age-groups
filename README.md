# SIRVSD model with age groups
---
Implementation of a SIRVSD model with different age groups and heterogeneous contacs in Python for Computational Models for Complex Systems Course.

## Usage
---
### Initialization

Install requirements:<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Run the project

Experiments can be run by executing the `main.py` as in `python main.py -d data/ -s /tmp`
